# Singly-Linear-Linked-List
Description:

This project presents an interactive graphical user interface (GUI) for visualizing and managing a singly linked list. The application provides an intuitive platform to perform various operations on a singly linked list, such as insertion, deletion, traversal, and searching.

Key Features:
1) Dynamic Visualization: The GUI dynamically updates to reflect the changes made to the linked list, allowing users to visualize the list structure in real-time.
2) User-Friendly Controls: Includes buttons and input fields for adding, removing, and manipulating nodes within the list.
3) Interactive Elements: Users can interact with the list elements by clicking and dragging nodes to rearrange or delete them.
4) Detailed Information Display: Shows detailed information about the current state of the list, including node values and list length.
5) Error Handling: Includes validation checks and informative error messages to guide users in correct list operations.

Technologies Used:
1) Programming Language: Python
2) GUI Framework: [Specify GUI Framework used, e.g., Tkinter, PyQt, etc.]
3) Data Structures: Singly Linked List

This project aims to provide a comprehensive tool for understanding and working with singly linked lists, making it an invaluable resource for students and professionals alike.
